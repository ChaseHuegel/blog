Welcome to my personal site
{: class="console"}

My name is Chase but I also go by *"Seven"* online and I am a mid 20s self-taught dev. I started coding when I was 11 and it kicked off a fascination with all things tech: hardware, software, programming, gaming, and generally how computers do things behind the screen.

I know a bit of everything when it comes to tech which makes me the go-to for hardware, software, or gaming woes from friends, family, and colleagues. All else fails, some troubleshooting or [google-fu](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=google-fu) does the trick.

More than anything I am a developer strong in `C#` and `Java` with experience across mediums like software, games, databases, servers, web, and more. I've been learning for over a decade. and just like with tech I've touched on most aspects of development.

This blog is dedicated to my ramblings so I can stop driving my wife and family nuts, I find discussing a topic helps me to better understand it or realize I need to learn more.

* I blog about prototypes, exploring new concepts, or whatever I am currently working on. Generally rambling about my latest adventures in coding.
* I am transferring content from an old blog and will continue to post new stuff, so stay tuned!

## Getting Started
As a kid I loved (still do!) to create, fix, and build things. My father was a coder so naturally tried to get me into programming. I saw `C++` on his screen *a lot* and it's awfully intimidating for a grade-schooler. He gave me a `C++` book that collected dust on my desk forever... That is until one evening I was bored, cracked open the book, installed Visual Studio, and never turned back.

> If you learn C++ then you will be able to learn any language!

I have heard this in one form or another countless times from my father, forums, videos, and even in the foreword of that book! I thought it was nonsense but 11 year old me rolled with it anyways. Looking back it was a cake walk exploring other languages and environments and perhaps I owe thanks to `C++` for that.

## First Steps
I got started by exploring games, it gave me quick feedback to what I was writing (or failing to). Few months go by learning `C++` and I had a text-based game engine, amazed by the possibilities. A while later I got into 2D with `Visual Basic`, `VBScript`, and toying with [Mirage Source](https://www.onrpg.com/games/mirage-source-game-engine/) and its offshoots like [Eclipse](https://www.indiedb.com/engines/eclipse-origins) confronting engines and tooling for the first time.

I explored a couple other languages (especially scripting), game engines, and modding games like [Counter-Strike 1.6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike#Counter-Strike), [Morrowind](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/morrowind), and [Combat Arms](https://combatarms-r.valofe.com/). I tinkered created small tools for modding and a couple engines, including DLL libraries for [GameMaker 7/8](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker). I eventually decided to write a hot-loading [scripting language](https://github.com/ChaseHuegel/chs-script) in `C++` and incorporated into my own DX game engine.

<br/>

I built a bunch of things during that time and the few complete or fun enough were released on various game dev forums...
* **Tuxedo Battle** a 3D fighting game where you defend the honor of your insulted tux in [street fighter](https://streetfighter.com/) inspired action! This won a school-run game design competition
* **Super Pong** fast paced 4-player verus game inspired by [Atari Warlords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlords_(1980_video_game)) where each player defends their "fort" from a ball using paddles
* **Eternal Realms** a 2D skilling ORPG inspired by [runescape](https://www.runescape.com/community). It ran for 2 years off donations.
* **Circa 1350** medieval kingdom management game planned to evolve into a [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) inspired colony sim. This was the first game I didn't release for free and it collected a modest number of sales.
* **ObjectMaster** an object implementation alternative to the builtin for [GameMaker 7/8](https://www.yoyogames.com/en/gamemaker). Performance began to break down around 100 objects to a scene in GameMaker, so I wrote an Entity-like solution which pushed that up to around `3,000` objects. This was used in a [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) game with `20,000+ reviews` until the faster GM:Studio released.

## Moving Forward
A couple years later I looked toward exploring software and architecture to mature my dev process. I picked up `Java` developing plugins for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) server software called [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/), these ranged from game mods to APIs and creating hooks between plugins.

I got into server administration eventually running my own Minecraft server that I supported for many years where I fostered a community and built friendships strong to this day! During that time I picked up `C#` and built a suite of tools for file management, monitoring, support ticketing, and editing configs and databases. I learned a lot during those years!

I also co-wrote [RadialMenu](http://radialmenu.weebly.com/) with my father in `C#` where I was in charge of fixing bugs, design, QA, and structuring the app. It gives you a toolbar and, well, radial menu for shortcuts and macros for pens, tablets, and drawing monitors.

Deserving of a post of its own, I learned a lot from my most [trying project](http://waywardbeyond.weebly.com/what-is-wayward-beyond.html). I wanted to attempt a larger project before college so spent 3 years full-time on a sim-lite space sandbox using `C#` built on [Unity](https://unity.com/) and a custom written voxel engine. At the time [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/) was [Kickstarted](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game) and later near its release. I presented the project to the publishing director, securing a spot to launch with their upcoming store. I was also [Greenlit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419577736) with `3,000 votes` in under a month and partnered with [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) to also launch on the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) platform. The project was in the `Top 20` of [IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/) for a week and remained in `Top 100` through development. It was ambitious and reached a beta-ready state before I had to put it aside to focus on school. It was an exciting and thrlling time!

## Today
I continue to learn, improve, and have fun with programming by exploring different concepts and prototypes whether it's an app or a game. I do a lot of reading, watching videos, and listen to talks but I'm  also a hands on learner so keep myself busy with side projects in my freetime between work, a baby, and 2 ferrets.

<br/>

Some of these projects are simple apps to fill a niche or specific use I have. A few have been to make my day job easier like [WindowMirror](https://github.com/ChaseHuegel/WindowMirror), a quick tool to clean and reclaim screenspace at work, I have a bunch of windows up at any given time and it gets difficult playing jenga with them! Many of these apps are throwaways to learn and solve a quick problem, but projects like this may get more development if I see a good use for it.

<br/>

![wayward](/images/projects.jpg)
Other projects are based in game dev exploring things like procedural animation, terrain generation, or AI and pathing. My latest big project is a full featured C# game engine that will have me touching on just about every aspect of developing apps, games, and tools. It is a real test of my knowledge, and having experience in both software and games has been a boon to the process. It also got me revisiting areas that I'm rusty in such as writing netcode or building a renderer, two areas I haven't touched since college.

## Take Away

I have taken a variety of classes through highschool and college related to programming, the code was the easy part but I realized that with a lack of conventional education I fell short in areas like structure, terminology, and standard practices. With some self-improvement and studying I was able to build on that.

The flip side is being self-taught pushed me to focus on the code itself, I learned to produce efficient and good code and naturally I thought outside the box to solve problems on my own. I was able to spend the time getting to know not only the environment and language that I work with, but the fundamentals of how things work that makes it simple to pick up new environments and stacks.

I find that I still have a little ways to go in learning terminology. Understanding terms and concepts is the easy part, it comes with a little time and effort, but writing good code only comes with experience.
